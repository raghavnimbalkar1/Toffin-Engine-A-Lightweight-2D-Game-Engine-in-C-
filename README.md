# Toffin-Engine-A-Lightweight-2D-Game-Engine-in-C-
A foundational 2D game engine built from the ground up in modern C++ (17/20). It features a custom physics system with gravity and AABB collision resolution, alongside a ray casting module for spatial queries. The engine uses SFML for simple windowing and rendering, allowing the focus to remain on core architecture and design patterns
